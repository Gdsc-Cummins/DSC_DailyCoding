Matrix Exponentiation

This is one of the most used techniques in competitive programming. Let us first consider below simple question.
What is the minimum time complexity to find n’th Fibonacci Number?
We can find n’th Fibonacci Number in O(Log n) time using Matrix Exponentiation. Refer method 4 of this for details. In this post, a general implementation of Matrix
