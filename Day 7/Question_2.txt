Last Updated: 07-06-2020
Given an array that is sorted and then rotated around an unknown point. Find if the array has a pair with a given sum ‘x’. It may be assumed that all elements in the array are distinct.
Examples :
Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10}, x = 16
Output: true
There is a pair (6, 10) with sum 16

Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, x = 35
Output: true
There is a pair (26, 9) with sum 35

Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, x = 45
Output: false

There is no pair with sum 45.
