Fermat’s Last Theorem
According to Fermat’s Last Theorem, no three positive integers a, b, c satisfy the equation,   for any integer value of n greater than 2. For n = 1 and n = 2, the equation have infinitely many solutions.
Some solutions for n = 1 are,
 2 + 3 = 5
 7 + 13 = 20
 5 + 6 = 11
 10 + 9 = 19

Some solutions for n = 2 are,
