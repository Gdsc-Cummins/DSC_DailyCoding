Space optimization using bit manipulations.

There are many situations where we use integer values as an index in an array to see presence or absence. We can use bit manipulations to optimize space in such problems.

Let us consider the below problem as an example.

Given two numbers, say a and b, mark the multiples of 2 and 5 between a and b using less than O(|b â€“ a|) space and output each multiple.

Note: We have to mark the multiples, i.e., save (key, value) pairs in memory such that each key either has a value as 1 or 0 representing as multiple of 2 or 5 or not, respectively.

Examples :

Input : 2 10
Output : 2 4 5 6 8 10

Input: 60 95
Output: 60 62 64 65 66 68 70 72 74 75 76 78
80 82 84 85 86 88 90 92 94 95
