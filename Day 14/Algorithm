MO’s Algorithm (Query Square Root Decomposition)

Let us consider the following problem to understand MO’s Algorithm.

We are given an array and a set of query ranges; we must find the sum of every query range.

Example:
Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 8};
query[] = [0, 4], [1, 3] [2, 4]
Output: Sum of arr[] elements in range [0, 4] is 8
Sum of arr[] elements in range [1, 3] is 4
Sum of arr[] elements in range [2, 4] is 6
